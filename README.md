# everything-birthday
The only web app you need to help you celebrate the special days of your loved ones!

## Explanation of the Project
This web app is to help anyone with an account (free) remember the birthdays and wedding anniversaries of their friends, family and coworkers.
Once the user enters the name, event-type and date of the celebration, this app will automatically email them the day before to remind them.

## What I Have Learned so Far
This project is still under development, but I have already gained a lot of knowledge and practice in areas including:
- Code First interaction with database
- foreign key references and one-to-many relationships
- different methods for implementing Bootstrap styling
- using ApplicationUser (and their email address!) in an app

I look forward to deploying the finished site soon, and further broadening my skills along the way!

Thank you for taking the time to review my work!
